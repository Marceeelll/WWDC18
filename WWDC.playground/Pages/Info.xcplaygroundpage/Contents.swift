 ## IMPORTANT
 
 Most of the time if the Playground-Project is startet for the first time it shows that it's missing files. It appears with storing the files in the "Source"-folder. My assumption is that Playground tries to start the project without having all files completly compiled... I really hope that this don't effect the judgment process. I already startet a tread in the WWDC Schoolarship Forum and other developers seem to have the same problem. Thank you :)
 

 
 # About:
 I ‚ù§Ô∏è creating UIElements so I decided to create my own Calendar. Then I had the idea to play a small particle animation to the diferent types of events. To get faster into the zusammenh√§nge of the different parameters I created a Particle Creator, mit dem all meine Animationen erstellt wurden.

 # Features:
 
 ### UICalendarView üìÖ
 With this UICalendarView it is super easy to give the user a well looking overview about his upcoming events. The user can navigation between the months and select a day to get a detail overview about the events on that selected day. Days that contain a event are highlighted different so that the user can see his events faster.

 ### UIOverview üîç
 The UICalendarOverview is an extension to the UICalendarView and represents the events of the selected day in the calendar. With a touch on a cell an animation will appear depended of the selected event. Each EventType has it's own animation. There are six different type of events.

 ### Filter Event Types ‚öôÔ∏è
 In a real world situation the user could could add a lot of eventy and by the time the calendar will be overcrowded. To still guarntee a good overview the user can filter and select which type of events should be shown.
