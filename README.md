## Features:

### UICalendarView üìÖ
With this UICalendarView it is super easy to give the user a well looking overview about his upcoming events. The user can navigation between the months and select a day to get a detail overview about the events on that selected day. Days that contain a event are highlighted different so that the user can see his events faster.

The UICalendarOverview is an extension to the UICalendarView and represents the events of the selected day in the calendar. With a touch on a cell an animation will appear depended of the selected event. Each EventType has it's own animation. There are six different type of events.

### Filter Event Types ‚öôÔ∏è
In a real world situation the user could could add a lot of eventy and by the time the calendar will be overcrowded. To still guarntee a good overview the user can filter and select which type of events should be shown.
